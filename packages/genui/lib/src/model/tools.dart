/// external environment or perform specific actions. For example, a tool could
/// allow the AI to save a file, query a database, or call an external API.
///
/// Concrete tool implementations must extend this class and provide:
/// - A unique [name] for the tool.
/// - A [description] of what the tool does, which helps the AI understand when
///   to use it.
/// - Optionally, a [parameters] schema defining the arguments the tool expects.
/// - An implementation of the [invoke] method to execute the tool's logic.
///
/// The generic argument determines the return type of [invoke], and must extend
/// a `Json` because that's what is required by the Gemini tool
/// calling API.

  ///   of arguments the tool accepts. If the tool requires no arguments, this
